- Displaying Data: Easily view essential information.
- Adding Data: Seamlessly add new items or details.
- Updating Data: Modify existing information as needed.
- Deleting Data: Remove outdated or unnecessary entries.
- Sales Transactions: Perform calculations for seamless transaction management.
  
Join me as I showcase the capabilities of my coffee shop cashier simulation. Let's enhance operational efficiency together! ðŸŒŸ #Python #CapstoneProject #CoffeeShop #CashierSimulation
