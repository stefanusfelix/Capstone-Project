Hello everyone, I'm Stefanus Felix.

I want to share my first capstone project using Python.

This project provides a simulation experience of a cashier machine in a coffee shop.

Here are some features available in this program:

1. Displaying data,
2. Adding data,
3. Updating data,
4. Deleting data,
5. Sales transactions
